    <p>15世纪后期，殖民者为了增加对“低等种族”的压迫，
    逐渐形成了种族主义观念。在美国，从1619年第一批黑奴被贩卖到北美大陆开始，
    黑人被当作奴隶使用，开启了美国的奴隶制历史，被视为低等的“工具”。这种奴
    隶制的存在使白人对黑人的偏见逐渐固化，成为种族歧视的开端。在美国南北战争后，虽
    然奴隶制被废除，但种族歧视并未消失，通过法律制度化，继续限制黑人等有色人种的权利。
    这些法律将种族偏见深入人心，限制了黑人的人身自由、选举权、教育权等基本权利，使种族主义流传了百年，直到现在在文化方面，在殖民时代，
    西方社会普遍将白人文化视为优越文化，而将其他种族的文化视为“野蛮”或“落后”的文化在现代社会，种族歧视的偏见仍然存在，例如，在美国，黑人等少数族裔在就业、
    教育、医疗等方面仍然面临诸多不平等，这种不平等进一步强化了种族偏见。一些政治势力为了维护自身利益，也会利用种族偏见来制造社会分裂。例如，美国的一些政治人物为了赢得选民支持，
    会采取反移民、反少数族裔的政策，进一步加剧了种族歧视问题。</p>

    <b>Historical reasons </b>

   <p> In the late 15th century, colonists gradually developed the concept of racism to intensify their oppression of "inferior races". In the United States, since the first batch of black slaves were sold to the North American continent in 1619, blacks were used as slaves, initiating the history of slavery in the United States and being regarded as inferior "tools". The existence of this slavery system solidified the prejudice of whites against blacks, marking the beginning of racial discrimination. After the American Civil War, although slavery was abolished, racial discrimination did not disappear. It was institutionalized through laws, continuing to restrict the rights of blacks and other people of color. These laws deeply ingrained racial prejudice, restricting the basic rights of blacks such as personal freedom, the right to vote, and the right to education, allowing racism to persist for a hundred years and still exist today. In terms of culture, during the colonial era, Western society generally regarded white culture as superior and other racial cultures as "barbaric" or "backward". In modern society, racial discrimination still exists. For instance, in the United States, minorities such as blacks still face many inequalities in employment, education, and healthcare, which further reinforces racial prejudice. Some political forces also use racial prejudice to create social division for their own interests. For example, some American politicians adopt anti-immigrant and anti-minority policies to win over voters, 
    further exacerbating the problem of racial discrimination.</p>
