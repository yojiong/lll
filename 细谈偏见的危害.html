    <p style="font-size: 25px;color: brown;text-align: center;">细谈偏见的危害Discussion on the HHarm of PPrejudice</p>
    <b>1.心理与情绪的长期创伤Long-term psychological and emotional trauma</b>
       <p>  种族歧视对个人心理的伤害往往是长期且深层的。被歧视者不仅会感受到羞辱与孤立，还可能逐渐内化社会对其族群的负面标签，产生自我怀疑与身份困惑。这种内在压力可能导致焦虑、忧郁，甚至创伤后压力症候群。
        许多社会研究与人类学调查都指出，被歧视族群往往必须在日常生活中不断进行「自我修正」，以符合主流期待，这种「隐性生存压力」极具破坏性。   
    </p><p>The harm of racial discrimination to an individual's psychology is often long-term and deep. Those who are discriminated against not only feel humiliated and isolated, but may also gradually internalize the negative labels society has imposed on their ethnic group, leading to self-doubt and identity confusion. This kind of internal pressure may lead to anxiety, depression and even post-traumatic stress disorder. Many social studies and anthropological investigations have pointed out that discriminated groups often have to constantly "self-correct" in their 
        daily lives to meet mainstream expectations. This "hidden survival pressure" is highly destructive.</p>
    <b>2.社会资源分配的不平等Inequality in the distribution of social resources</b>
    <p>偏见会在教育、医疗、就业等层面产生制度性的不平等，使得某些族群长期处于资源边缘地带。这种现象并非单纯的经济问题，
        而是一种以文化与种族为划分基础的权力分配。人类学家常透过田野研究揭示，看似「正常运作」的社会制度，其实在背后深藏着对特定族群的排除与剥削，导致结构性的社会阶层再生产。</p>
    <p>Prejudice can create institutional inequalities in areas such as education, healthcare and employment, keeping certain ethnic groups on the fringes of resources for a long time. This phenomenon is not merely an economic issue, but rather a distribution of power based on culture and race. Anthropologists often reveal through field research that seemingly "functioning normally" social systems actually conceal the exclusion and exploitation
         of specific groups behind the scenes, leading to structural social class reproduction.</p>    <b>3.激化族群对立与社会冲突Intensify ethnic opposition and social conflicts</b>
    <p>种族偏见往往强化「我们」与「他们」的界线，使不同族群彼此敌视与防备，进而引发歧视性言论、
        仇恨犯罪，甚至族群暴力。历史上不少冲突，如种族清洗、殖民暴政、警察暴力等，皆与深层的种族偏见有关。当偏见被政治或媒体操弄时，更容易转化为集体情绪与仇恨，扩大冲突范围与破坏力。</p>
    <p>Racial prejudice often reinforces the line between "us" and "them", making different ethnic groups hostile and on guard against each other, and thereby triggering discriminatory speech, hate crimes, and even ethnic violence. Many conflicts in history, such as ethnic cleansing, colonial tyranny, and police violence, are all related to deep-seated racial prejudice. When prejudice is manipulated by politics or the media, it is more likely to
         transform into collective emotions and hatred, expanding the scope and destructive power of conflicts.</p>
        <b>4.剥夺文化认同感与自我价值Deprive people of cultural identity and self-worth</b>
    <p>在充满偏见的社会氛围中，被歧视者常为了融入主流文化而被迫压抑或放弃自己的文化传统，造成文化同质化与自我价值的流失。
        尤其是移民或少数族群的下一代，可能会因羞于认同自己的出身而产生身份危机。人类学强调，每个文化都具独特价值，偏见使得部分文化被边缘化，导致全球文化多样性的破坏。</p>
    <p>In a social atmosphere full of prejudice, those who are discriminated against are often forced to suppress or abandon their cultural traditions in order to integrate into the mainstream culture, resulting in cultural homogenization and the loss of self-worth. Especially the next generation of immigrants or ethnic minorities may experience an identity crisis due to their shyness in acknowledging their origin. Anthropology emphasizes that each culture has unique value. 
        Prejudice marginalizes some cultures, leading to the destruction of global cultural diversity.</p>

        <b>5. 制度性压迫与结构性不正义Institutional oppression and structural injustice</b>
        <p>当偏见被纳入法律、政策或组织运作时，就会演变为制度性的压迫。例如在招聘制度中对某些族裔的潜在排斥，
        或在学术评鉴中忽略特定文化观点的价值，这些都是种族歧视转化为结构性不 正义的例子。这种隐性但普遍的压迫形式，
        更加难以被察觉与纠正，却对被歧视群体造成长远伤害。</p>
        <p>When prejudice is incorporated into laws, policies or organizational operations, it will evolve into institutional oppression. For instance, the potential exclusion of certain ethnic groups in the recruitment system, or the neglect of the value of specific cultural viewpoints in academic evaluations, these are all examples of racial discrimination transforming into structural injustice. This implicit but widespread form of oppression is even more difficult to detect and correct, 
            yet it causes long-term harm to the discriminated groups.</p>
    <b> 6.助长文化霸权与去多样化 Promote cultural hegemony and de-diversification</b>
       <p>偏见促使主流文化将自身标准视为「正统」，并以此贬抑他者文化，使文化交流变成单向的同化压力。在全球化与后殖民背景下，
        这种文化霸权不但使非主流文化逐渐被边缘化，甚至会被视为落后或需被「拯救」的对象。人类学对此提出警告，指出文化的价值不应以主流眼光判定，每个文化都有其生存与发展的尊严。</p>
        <p>Prejudice prompts mainstream culture to regard its own standards as "orthodox" and thereby belittle other cultures, turning cultural exchange into a one-way assimilation pressure. Under the background of globalization and postcolonialism, this cultural hegemony not only gradually marginalizes non-mainstream cultures, but may even be regarded as backward or objects in need of "rescue". Anthropology has issued a warning on this, pointing out that the value of culture should not be judged by the mainstream perspective, 
            and every culture has its dignity for survival and development.</p>
    <b>7.阻碍族群融合与社会和谐Hindering ethnic integration and social harmony</b>
           <p> 偏见不仅破坏个体与文化的尊严，也直接影响族群间的融合与社会整体的和谐。当一个社会对少数族群充满偏见与排斥时，
            这些群体将难以安心地参与公共生活，导致社会裂痕持续扩大。人类学指出，唯有真正理解、尊重并接纳他者差异，社会才能建立基于多元与包容的稳定秩序。</p>
<p>Prejudice not only undermines the dignity of 
    individuals and cultures, but also directly affects the integration among ethnic groups and the overall harmony of society. When a society is full of prejudice and exclusion towards minority groups, these groups will find it difficult to participate in public life at ease, leading to the continuous expansion of social rifts. Anthropology points out that only by truly understanding, respecting and accepting the differences of others can society establish a stable order based on diversity and </p>
    inclusiveness.</body>
